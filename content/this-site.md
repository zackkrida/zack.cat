This site is a collection of markdown files, each with a custom `.yaml` header. Here's the header for this page, for example:

```yaml
title: 'this site'
date: '2023-11-08T05:35:07.322Z'
excerpt: 'notes on this website and how it was built.'
author:
  name: zack
  picture: '/assets/zack.jpg'
image:
  url: 'bananna-tree.jpg'
  alt: 'a bananna tree leaf'
  width: 1261
  height: 709
```

A few principles guide the site. I keep those in the project's [README](https://github.com/zackkrida/zack.cat?tab=readme-ov-file#principles) but I'll duplicate them here:

- Build process is totally distinct from content.
- Content is markdown. I like markdown.
- Content can me moved anywhere and built any way.
- Content is forever.
- Build process is ephemeral. If it works in ten years? Who cares? I'll swap it out with the flavor of the year.

It works without JavaScript but I do send over a chunk of JS if you have it enabled.
